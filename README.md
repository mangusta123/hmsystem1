J2EE-based web service oriented for academic course registration and assignment submission 


This system makes use of J2EE and is aimed to be used by faculty members as well as students by automating 

course registration and assignment submission process. Main objective was getting familiar with various aspects 

of development in J2EE, particularly JSP/Servlet technology which had become enormously popular and is deployed

widely in industry. Meanwhile I have explored infrastructure tools and approaches for system scaling (Cassandra, 

MapReduce/Hadoop, Scribe, Memcached, ZooKeeper) and ways of their application upon the course management system, 

although scalability did not constitute a big issue to be solved at that time, nevertheless it might be possible

that the system could eventually be used outside of main campus and aimed to manage several institutions within 

the city or province.

DB connectivity and web service were accomplished through JavaDB (Apache Derby) and Apache Tomcat (both have been 

integrated into NetBeans distribution)
